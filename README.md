## üìÉ How to Manage Git (Git Flow)

Follow these steps to work with Git effectively:

1. Switch to the `develop` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   ```
2. Always pull the latest changes from `develop` with the `--rebase` flag before coding:
   ```bash
   git pull origin develop --rebase
   ```
3. Create a new branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your_new_branch
   ```
   > **Note**: Always pull from `develop` before creating a new branch to ensure it's up-to-date.
4. Add the files you worked on:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
5. Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m 'Feature(nameOfFeature): Description of the feature'
   ```
   - Follow [Conventional Commits](https://mokkapps.de/blog/how-to-automatically-generate-a-helpful-changelog-from-your-git-commit-messages/#conventional-commits) for better commit messages.
6. Push your changes to your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin your_new_branch
   ```
7. Go to GitHub and create a **Pull Request (PR)** to be reviewed.
8. Before merging your branch into `develop`, test the production build locally:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```
9. Once approved, merge your branch into `develop`.
10. Continue working on the same branch if it's related to the same feature/fix, or create a new branch for new features.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The `main` and `develop` branches are protected. All changes must go through PRs.
